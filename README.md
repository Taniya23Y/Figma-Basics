- **Alignment and Distribution**: Organizing elements using alignment and distribution features.
- **Constraints**: Ensuring responsiveness of components.
- **Shortcuts and Functions**: Various shortcuts and functions in the design panel.
- **Exporting Screens**: Export settings, resolutions, file formats, and organizing exported files.
- **SVGs for Icons**: Exporting SVGs to avoid increasing app or website size.
- **Batch Renaming**: Batch renaming frames for organized exports.
- **Shared Designs**: Differences in view for users with edit access vs. viewing access.
- **Community Resources**: Availability of free design assets in the Figma Community.

## 🎨 Lecture - 2 =>  Basics of Frames and Autolayout
In this video, Ansh Mehra covers the basics of frames and autolayout, crucial for creating responsive designs.

### 🔑 Key Topics
- Understanding frames
- Using autolayout for responsive design
- Practical examples and exercises

### 📌 Takeaways
- **Groups vs. Frames**: Frames are more powerful due to constraints.
- **Horizontal and Vertical Constraints**: Explanation and practical examples.
- **Responsive vs. Adaptive Design**: Differences and practical applications.
- **Auto Layout**: Creating responsive designs that adjust based on content and constraints.
- **Designing UI Components**: Buttons, labels, and nested components.
- **Adaptive Layouts**: Adapting layouts for different devices like iPhones and iPads.
- **Responsify Plugin**: Testing designs on multiple devices.
- **Practice and Exploration**: Importance of practicing, exploring UI inspiration, and documenting learnings.
- **Upcoming Topics**: Styles and libraries, feedback, and suggestions for improving the course.

## 📚 Lecture - 3 => Styles and Libraries Explained
This tutorial dives into styles and libraries in Figma, explaining how to manage and utilize them effectively.

### 🔑 Key Topics
- Creating and applying styles
- Building and using component libraries
- Collaboration tips

### 📌 Takeaways
- **Design Tokens**: Organizing colors into categories (base, mid, contrast) using tokens for consistency.
- **Color Tokens**: Importance of clear and concise token names, using examples from Uber's design system (BASE).
- **Variables in Figma**: Creating a hierarchy of token values and aliases.
- **Saving Styles/Variables**: Naming and organizing styles effectively, using conventions like slashes and prefixes.
- **Consistency and Organization**: Maintaining consistency and organization within Figma files.
- **Useful Plugins**: Recommendations like Styler for managing styles.
- **Publishing Libraries**: Creating and publishing libraries for consistency across projects.
- **Learning and Feedback**: Encouragement to learn complex topics, watch previous videos, and engage in the learning process. Upcoming topics like components and variants were also teased.

## 🧩 Lecture - 4 => Basics of Components & Variants From Scratch
Learn about the basics of components and variants in Figma.

### 🔑 Key Topics
- Creating components
- Using and managing variants
- Best practices for component design

### 📌 Takeaways
- **Reusability:** Components in Figma allow you to reuse design elements across different screens or instances, which helps maintain consistency and saves time in your design process.
- **Efficiency with Variants:** Variants enable you to create multiple variations within a single component. This includes actions like swapping icons and toggling visibility, which add flexibility and streamline the design system.
- **Component Manipulation:** Learn how to manipulate and modify components and their instances in Figma. This includes understanding and applying Boolean properties, instance swapping, and text properties.
- **Organizational Benefits:** Utilizing instances within components simplifies editing and enhances the organization of your design system.
- **Advanced Concepts:** The tutorial introduces nested instances and properties, leading to a deeper understanding of how variants can be used to optimize design systems.
- **Library Syncing:** Detailed explanation of updating components across different files through libraries to ensure consistency and synchronization.


## 🧠 Lecture - 5 => Learn Figma Variables like a Pro In 2024
Ansh Mehra explains how to use variables in Figma like a professional.

### 🔑 Key Topics
- Introduction to Figma variables
- Practical applications and examples
- Tips and tricks for advanced usage

### 📌 Takeaways
- **Types of Variables:** Figma supports multiple variable types including color, number, string, and Boolean.
- **Color Variables:** Used for defining colors that can be reused across different components and themes.
- **Number Variables:** Useful for setting numeric values like dimensions or quantities in your designs.
- **String Variables:** Manage text content and labels dynamically.
- **Boolean Variables:** Control toggles and visibility states within components.
- **Multi-level Referencing:** Variables provide flexibility by allowing for complex referencing and adjustments within a design system.
- **Organizational Benefits:** Grouping variables into collections helps maintain consistency and ease of access.
- **Scoping Variables:** Variables can be scoped to different use cases, such as defining color palettes for light and dark themes or assigning specific values to components.
- **Collections and Groups:** Organizing variables into collections and groups streamlines their management and application across your projects.
- **Comparison with Styles:** Unlike styles, which support complex layering and properties, variables are simpler and cater to more straightforward value management.
- **Interactive Prototypes:** Learn how to use variables to create dynamic prototypes. This includes setting up variables that change based on user interactions, like buttons triggering number count changes.
- **Practical Examples:** The video provides step-by-step examples of setting up and manipulating variables within a prototype scenario to demonstrate their functionality.
